### Iris flower classification with RBF using MATLAB

#### Network settings:
```
Training data = 70%, Test data = 30%
Epochs = 100

Goal = 0;
Spread = 2.500;
MN = 8;                                     
DF = 2;   

Average accuracy = 97.733%
```

#### Cross-validation
With the same configurations as the previous network, the K-Fold cross validation technique was implemented.
Considering K = 10.
Average accuracy obtained = 97.3%
